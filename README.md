# Demand-Forecasting-for-Shared-Micro-Mobility-Services

This project explores the factors influencing demand for shared electric bikes using two years of hourly rental data. The analysis centers around uncovering patterns through EDA and validating assumptions with statistical hypothesis testing.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

Performed detailed exploratory data analysis to understand usage trends by hour, day, season, and weather; handled outliers and engineered time-based features.

Used correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and boxplots to reveal relationships between rental counts and independent variables.

Conducted Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests to validate assumptions of normality and equal variance before statistical testing.

Applied t-tests (weekdays vs weekends), ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis tests (weather and season impacts), and Chi-square tests (weather-season dependence) to derive actionable insights.

Findings support strategic decisions like seasonal promotions, time-based pricing, and weather-aware operational planning.

ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA

Scikit-learn for modeling (Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression)

Metrics: RÂ², RMSE for performance comparison
