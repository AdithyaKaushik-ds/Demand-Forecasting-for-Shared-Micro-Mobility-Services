# Demand-Forecasting-for-Shared-Micro-Mobility-Services

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the demand for a shared electric cycle rental service in a major urban Indian environment. The goal was to identify key factors influencing usage patterns and build a predictive model to assist in operational and strategic decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess seasonal trends, user segmentation (casual vs. registered), and weather impact.

Engineered relevant features including datetime decomposition (hour, weekday, season), and assessed multicollinearity among predictors.

Built and evaluated multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Trees to predict daily and hourly demand.

Derived business insights such as higher demand during working hours, significant seasonal patterns, and weather sensitivity affecting casual riders more than registered ones.

ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA

Scikit-learn for modeling (Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression)

Metrics: RÂ², RMSE for performance comparison
